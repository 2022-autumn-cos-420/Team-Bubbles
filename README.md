With the explosion of technology and social media in the modern world, there are more ways than ever for students with inattentive disorders to become distracted and fail to finish their school tasks on time, resulting in mental stress which can snowball into mental health issues. For example, attempting to complete assignments, far too often notifications from phones can provide an easy way to leave an assignment for long enough that it's never returned to. While there are many task management softwareâ€™s out there, the major free ones like Trello are designed for neurotypical people and more specialized software is trapped behind a paywall and does nothing to limit notifications themselves. How might we create a free app that will reduce the amount of notifications students see and create a system that will check in frequently to make sure tasks are being completed.
